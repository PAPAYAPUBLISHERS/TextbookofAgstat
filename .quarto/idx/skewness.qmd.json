{"title":"Skewness and kurtosis","markdown":{"headingText":"Skewness and kurtosis","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nIn the previous chapter, we explored numerical measures of central tendency and dispersion. Together, these measures give us insights into the location and spread of our data. However, they don’t fully describe the data distribution. What about its shape?\n\nThe shape of a distribution helps us understand the symmetry, peakedness, and presence of tails in the data. While a histogram provides a visual summary of the shape, we often need numerical measures for precise analysis. These measures include:\n\n-   **Skewness**, which quantifies the degree of asymmetry in the data distribution.\n-   **Kurtosis**, which measures the \"tailedness\" or peakedness of the distribution.\n\nIn this chapter, we will have a detailed discussion on these two important measures of shape, understanding how they are calculated and interpreted. By the end, you’ll be able to evaluate whether a distribution is symmetric, positively or negatively skewed, and whether it has light or heavy tails.\n\n## Skewness\n\nSkewness is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of symmetry. Then you may ask, what will a symmetric distribution looks like. Histogram of a symmetric distribution is showed in @fig-histosymm.\n\n![Histogram of a symmetric distribution](images/Hist1.png){#fig-histosymm fig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\" style=\"text-align:center;\"}\n\nA distribution, or data set, is symmetric if it looks the same to the left and right of the centre point. In our discussion we are including only unimodal cases.\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Note\"}\nFor a symmetric distribution skewness = 0; mean = median = mode. @fig-symmdist shows how a symmetric distribution looks like.\n:::\n\n![symmetric distribution](images/image3_5.jpeg){#fig-symmdist fig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\" style=\"text-align:center;\"}\n\n@fig-histodata shows a model data set with skewness = 0 (symmetric distribution) \n\n![Data set with skewness = 0](images/image4_5.jpeg){#fig-histodata fig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\" style=\"text-align:center;\"}\n\n### Negatively skewed\n\nA negatively skewed distribution, also known as a left-skewed distribution, is characterized by a longer tail on the left side of the distribution. The bulk of the data values, or the \"mass\" of the distribution, is concentrated on the right, as shown in @fig-leftskew.\n\nThis type of distribution is referred to as left-skewed, left-tailed, or skewed to the left because of the extended left tail. In such cases, the numerical relationship between the mean, median, and mode typically follows this pattern:\n\nMean \\< Median \\< Mode\n\nThis occurs because the mean is pulled towards the longer tail, while the median and mode remain closer to the center of the data's bulk.\n\n![Left skewed or negatively skewed distribution](images/image5_5.jpeg){#fig-leftskew fig-align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"50%\"}\n\n@fig-negskewed shows a model dataset with negative skewness.\n\n![Negatively skewed data set](images/image6_5.jpeg){#fig-negskewed fig-align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"50%\"}\n\n### Positively skewed\n\nA positively skewed distribution, also known as a right-skewed distribution, is characterized by a longer tail on the right side. The bulk of the data values, or the \"mass\" of the distribution, is concentrated on the left, as illustrated in @fig-posskewed.\n\nThis type of distribution is referred to as right-skewed, right-tailed, or skewed to the right, due to the extended tail on the right. In such cases, the relationship between the mean, median, and mode typically follows this pattern:\n\nMean \\> Median \\> Mode\n\nThis occurs because the mean is influenced by the extreme values in the longer right tail, while the median and mode remain closer to the center of the data's bulk.\n\n![Right skewed or positively skewed distribution](images/image7_5.jpeg){#fig-posskewed fig-align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"50%\"}\n\n@fig-rightskeweddat shows a model dataset with positive skewness.\n\n![Data set with positive skewness or right skewed](images/image8_5.jpeg){#fig-rightskeweddat fig-align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"50%\"}\n\n## Measures of skewness\n\nThe direction and extent of skewness can be measured in various ways. We shall discuss four measures.\n\n### Karl Pearson's coefficient of skewness ($S_{k}$)\n\nYou have noticed that the mean, median and mode are not equal in a skewed distribution. The Karl Pearson's measure of skewness is based upon the divergence of mean from mode in a skewed distribution.\n\n$$S_{k} = \\frac{mean - mode}{\\text{standard deviation}}$$ {#eq-karlsq}\n\nThe sign of $S_{k}$ gives the direction of skewness and its magnitude gives the extent of skewness. If $S_{k}$ \\> 0, the distribution is positively skewed, and if $S_{k}$ \\< 0 it is negatively skewed.\n\nIn @eq-karlsq since mode is used, there is a problem that if mode is not defined for a distribution we cannot find $S_{k}$. But empirical relation between mean, median and mode states that, for a moderately symmetrical distribution $\\ mean - mode \\approx 3(mean - median)$. So @eq-karlsq can be written as\n\n$$S_{k} = \\frac{3(mean - median)}{\\text{standard deviation}}$$ {#eq-karlsq2}\n\n**Example 7.1** Compute the Karl Pearson's coefficient of skewness from the following data:\n\n| Height (*x*) | frequency (*f*) |\n|:------------:|:---------------:|\n|      58      |       10        |\n|      59      |       18        |\n|      60      |       30        |\n|      61      |       42        |\n|      62      |       35        |\n|      63      |       28        |\n|      64      |       16        |\n|      65      |        8        |\n\n: Model dataset for skewness calculation {#tbl-skewnessmodel .bordered}\n\n**Solution 7.1**\n\n```{r ex75, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,results='asis'}\n#| label: tbl-karlskew\n#| tbl-cap: \"Karl Pearson's coefficient of skewness\"\n#| fig-cap: \"Karl Pearson's coefficient of skewness\"  \n#| filters: \n#| - parse-latex  \n\n\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\ndt<-read.csv(\"csv/Book23.csv\")\ncolnames(dt) <- c(\"Height ($x_{i}$)\",\"frequency ($f_{i}$)\",\"$f_{i}x_{i}$\",\"$f_{i}x_{i}^{2}$\")\ndt %>%\n  kbl(booktabs = TRUE, align = \"c\", escape = FALSE) %>%\n   kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = \"Georgia\") %>%\nkable_styling(\n    # latex_options = \"HOLD_position\", \n    full_width = FALSE,\n    position = \"center\", \n    bootstrap_options = \"bordered\"\n  ) \n```\n\nMean, $\\overline{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{f_{i}x_{i}}}{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f_{i}}$ = $\\frac{11482}{187} = 61.40$\n\n${sample\\ variance,\\ s}^{2}$ using @eq-sdfreq = $\\frac{705588 - \\frac{\\left( 11482 \\right)^{2}}{187}}{186} = 3.123$\n\n$standard\\ deviation,\\ s = \\sqrt{3.123} = 1.76$\n\nTo calculate the median, refer to the table @tbl-karlcf.

However, in order to use it you must know the mean, mode (or median) and standard deviation for your data. Sometimes you might not have that information; instead you might have information about quartiles. If that's the case, you can use Bowley's measure of skewness as an alternative to find out more about the asymmetry of your distribution. It's very useful if you have extreme data values (outliers) or if you have an open-ended distribution.\n\n$${Bowley’s\\ measure\\ of\\ Skewness,\\ S}_{Q} = \\frac{\\left( Q_{3} - Q_{2} \\right) - \\left( Q_{2} - Q_{1} \\right)}{\\left( Q_{3} - Q_{2} \\right) + \\left( Q_{2} - Q_{1} \\right)}$$ {#eq-bowleyssk}\n\nWhere $Q_{1}$= 1^st^ quartile; $Q_{2}$ = median; $Q_{3}$= 3^rd^ quartile\n\nEquation can be further modified into\n\n$$S_{Q} = \\frac{Q_{3} - 2Q_{2} + Q_{1}}{Q_{3} - Q_{1}}$$ {#eq-bowleyssk2}\n\n-   $S_{Q}$= 0 means that the curve is symmetrical.\n\n-   $S_{Q}$ \\> 0 means the curve is positively skewed.\n\n-   $S_{Q}$\\< 0 means the curve is negatively skewed.\n\nLets find Bowley's measure of skewness for @tbl-skewnessmodel in Example 7.1 from the cumulative frequency in @tbl-karlcf, quartiles can be calculated. Calculation of$\\text{Q}_{1}$, $Q_{2}$, $Q_{3}$ is given in @sec-quartile.\n\n$${Q}_{1} = 60$$\n\n$$Q_{2} = 61$$\n\n$$Q_{3} = 63$$\n\n$$S_{Q} = \\frac{63 - (2 \\times 61) + 60}{63 - 60} = \\ \\frac{1}{3} = 0.33$$\n\nSince $S_{Q}$ \\> 0 means the curve is positively skewed.\n\n### Kelly's measure of skewness (*S*~p~)\n\nBowley's measure of skewness is based on the middle 50% of the observations; it leaves 25% of the observations on each extreme of the distribution. As an improvement over Bowley's measure, Kelly has suggested a measure based on Percentiles, including *P*~10~ and *P*~90~ so that only 10% of the observations on each extreme are ignored.\n\n$${Kelly's\\ Measure\\ of\\ Skewness,\\ S}_{p} = \\frac{\\left( P_{90} - P_{50} \\right) - \\left( P_{50} - P_{10} \\right)}{\\left( P_{90} - P_{50} \\right) + \\left( P_{50} - P_{10} \\right)}$$ {#eq-kellyskew}\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n**Try yourself**\\\nTry to find Kelly's Measure of Skewness for @tbl-skewnessmodel\n:::\n\n### Measure based on moments\n\nBefore going into measuring skewness using moments, one should know what a moment is:\n\n**Moments**\n\nThe ***r***^**th**^ **moment about mean** of a distribution, denoted by ***μ***~**r**~ is given by\n\n$$\\mu_{r} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{f_{i}\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{r}}}{N}$$ {#eq-moments}\n\nWhere $f_{i}$ is the frequency of *i*^th^ observation or class mark$\\ x_{i}$, $N = \\sum_{}^{}f_{i}$, number of observations\n\nMoment about mean is also called as **central moment**\n\nIf *r* = 0, $\\mu_{0} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{f_{i}\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{0}}}{N}$ = 1\n\nIf *r* = 1, $\\mu_{1} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{f_{i}\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{1}}}{N}$ = 0 (sum of deviation about mean is zero)\n\nIf *r* = 2, $\\mu_{2} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{f_{i}\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{2}}}{N}$ = $\\sigma^{2}$, Population variance\n\nIn short values of following moments about mean are\n\n| **Moments about mean** |  **Value**   |\n|:----------------------:|:------------:|\n|      $$\\mu_{0}$$       |      1       |\n|      $$\\mu_{1}$$       |      0       |\n|      $$\\mu_{2}$$       | $\\sigma^{2}$ |\n\n: Moments about mean {#tbl-momentsabtmean .bordered}\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Note\"}\nIt should be remembered that first moment about mean is 0 and second moment about mean is **variance**.\n:::\n\nfor @tbl-skewnessmodel in Example 7.1 given above, calculate third central moment, $\\mu_{3}$\n\n```{r ex76, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,results='asis'}\n#| label: tbl-moment3\n#| tbl-cap: \"Third central moment calculation\"  \n#| fig-cap: \"Third central moment calculation\" \n#| filters: \n#| - parse-latex   \n\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\ndt<-read.csv(\"csv/Book24.csv\")\ncolnames(dt) <- c(\"Height ($x_{i}$)\",\"frequency ($f_{i}$)\",\"$\\\\left( x_{i}-\\\\overline{x} \\\\right)^{3}$\",\"${f_{i}\\\\left( x_{i}-\\\\overline{x}\\\\right)}^{3}$\")\ndt %>%\n  kbl(booktabs = TRUE, align = \"c\", escape = FALSE) %>%\n   kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = \"Georgia\") %>%\nkable_styling(\n    # latex_options = \"HOLD_position\", \n    full_width = FALSE,\n    position = \"center\", \n    bootstrap_options = \"bordered\"\n  )\n```\n\nMean = 61.40\n\n$$\\mu_{3} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{f_{i}\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{3}}}{N} = \\ \\frac{49.832}{187} = 0.266$$\n\n#### Beta one and gamma one\n\nThe moment measure of skewness is based on the property that, for a symmetrical distribution, all odd ordered central moments are equal to zero. We note that $\\mu_{1}$ = 0, for every distribution, therefore, the lowest order moment that can provide an absolute measure of skewness is $\\text{μ}_{3}$. So measures of skewness are based on $\\text{μ}_{3}$.\n\n$$\\beta_{1} = \\frac{\\mu_{3}^{2}}{\\mu_{2}^{3}}$$ {#eq-betaone}\n\nPronounced as 'beta one'\n\n$\\beta_{1}$= 0 means that the curve is symmetrical. The greater the value of $\\beta_{1}$ the more skewed the distribution. One serious limitation of $\\beta_{1}$ is that it cannot tell the direction of skewness *i*.*e*. whether it is positive or negative. Since $\\text{μ}_{2}$ is always positive (as it is variance) and $\\mu_{3}^{2}$ is positive, $\\beta_{1}$ will be positive always. This drawback is removed by calculating $\\text{γ}_{1}$, called as Karl Pearson's$\\text{ γ}_{1}$, pronounced as 'gamma one'.\n\n$$\\gamma_{1} = \\sqrt{\\beta_{1}} = \\frac{\\mu_{3}}{\\mu_{2}^{3}}$$ {#eq-gammaone}\n\nIf $\\mu_{3}$ is positive $\\gamma_{1}$ is positive, If $\\mu_{3}$ is negative $\\gamma_{1}$ is negative\n\n-   $\\gamma_{1}$= 0 means that the curve is symmetrical.\n\n-   $\\gamma_{1}$ \\> 0 means the curve is positively skewed.\n\n-   $\\gamma_{1}$\\< 0 means the curve is negatively skewed.\n\nfor @tbl-skewnessmodel in Example 7.1, $\\beta_{1}$ and $\\gamma_{1}$ can be calculated as follows\n\n$\\mu_{3}$= 0.226\n\n$\\mu_{2}$= 3.123\n\n$\\beta_{1} = \\frac{\\mu_{3}^{2}}{\\mu_{2}^{3}}$ = $\\frac{\\left( 0.226 \\right)^{2}}{\\left( 3.123 \\right)^{3}} = \\ \\frac{0.051}{30.46} = 0.0016$\n\n$\\gamma_{1} = \\sqrt{\\beta_{1}} = \\ \\sqrt{0.0016} = + 0.04$\n\nSince $\\mu_{3}$ is positive $\\gamma_{1}$is positive. Since $\\gamma_{1}$ is slightly greater than 0, distribution is a slightly skewed to right.\n\n## Kurtosis\n\nKurtosis is a statistical measure that describes the shape of a distribution's frequency curve, focusing on its relative peakedness. While skewness measures the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in a distribution, kurtosis evaluates how sharp or flat the peak of the curve is. There are three categories of frequency curves depending upon the shape of their peak as shown in @fig-kurtopeak.\n\n![Three categories of frequency curves](images/image10_5.jpeg){#fig-kurtopeak fig-align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"40%\"}\n\nKurtosis refers to degree of flatness or peakedness of the curve. It is measured relative to the peakedness of normal curve. The normal curve is considered as *mesokurtic*. If a curve is more peaked than normal curve, it is called *leptokurtic*. If a curve is more flat-topped than normal curve, it is called *platykurtic*. The condition of peakedness (leptokurtic) or flatness (platykurtic) is called **kurtosis of excess**.\n\n### Measure of kurtosis\n\nKurtosis is measured using $\\beta_{2}$ 'beta two' and $\\gamma_{2}$ 'gamma two' given by Karl Pearson\n\n$$\\beta_{2} = \\frac{\\mu_{4}}{\\mu_{2}^{2}}$$ {#eq-beta2}\n\nWhere $\\mu_{4}$ is the 4^th^ central moment, $\\mu_{2}$ is the 2^nd^ central moment\n\n-   $\\beta_{2}$= 3 means that the curve is mesokurtic.\n\n-   $\\beta_{2}$ \\> 3 means the curve is leptokurtic.\n\n-   $\\beta_{2}$\\< 3 means the curve is platykurtic.\n\n$$\\gamma_{2} = \\beta_{2} - 3$$ {#eq-gamma2}\n\n-   $\\gamma_{2}$= 0 means that the curve is mesokurtic.\n\n-   $\\gamma_{2}$ \\> 0 means the curve is leptokurtic.\n\n-   $\\gamma_{2}$\\< 0 means the curve is platykurtic.\n\nfor @tbl-skewnessmodel in Example 7.1, kurtosis can be examined as follows\n\n```{r ex77, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,results='asis'}\n#| label: tbl-kutocalc\n#| tbl-cap: \"Measures of kurtosis\"\n#| fig-cap: \"Measures of kurtosis\"  \n#| filters: \n#| - parse-latex    \n\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\ndt<-read.csv(\"csv/Book25.csv\")\ncolnames(dt) <- c('Height ($x_{i}$)','frequency ($f_{i}$)','$\\\\left( x_{i}-\\\\overline{x} \\\\right)^{4}$','${f_{i}\\\\left( x_{i}-\\\\overline{x}\\\\right)}^{4}$')\ndt %>%\n  kbl(booktabs = TRUE, align = \"c\", escape = FALSE) %>%\n   kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = \"Georgia\") %>%\nkable_styling(\n    # latex_options = \"HOLD_position\", \n    full_width = FALSE,\n    position = \"center\", \n    bootstrap_options = \"bordered\"\n  )  \n```\n\nMean, $\\overline{x}$= 61.40\n\n$\\mu_{2}$ = 3.123 (calculation shown in previous example)\n\n$\\mu_{4} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{f_{i}\\left( x_{i} - \\overline{x} \\right)^{4}}}{N} = \\frac{4312.747}{187} = 23.062$\n\n$\\beta_{2} = \\frac{\\mu_{4}}{\\mu_{2}^{2}} = \\frac{23.062}{\\left( 3.123 \\right)^{2}} = 2.364$\n\n$\\beta_{2}$ is 2.364, which is close to 3, distribution can be considered slightly platykurtic close to symmetric.\n\nYou can verify the frequency curve of Example 7.1 @fig-freqcurvex, it can be seen that it is slightly right tailed (positively skewed)\n\n![Frequency curve of Example 7.1](images/image11_5.jpeg){#fig-freqcurvex fig-align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"40%\"}\n\n \\\n \\\n  \n\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Historical Insights\"}  \n\n**\"Crabs and kurtosis\"**\n\nThe story of **kurtosis** and **skewness** begins with a fascinating scientific journey involving **crabs**! In the late 1800s, Karl Pearson, a pioneering statistician, worked with biologist Walter Weldon to study variations in the size of crustaceans, like crabs. They noticed that the data didn't follow the usual normal pattern, so Pearson developed new tools to better understand the shapes of these unusual data distributions. \n\nHe created the concept of **skewness** to measure whether the data was symmetrical or had long tails on one side. Then, he developed **kurtosis**, a measure of how \"peaked\" or \"flat\" the data distribution was compared to the normal curve. These ideas helped statisticians better analyze data that didn’t fit the typical patterns, paving the way for modern statistical tools we still use today!
