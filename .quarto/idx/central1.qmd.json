In this chapter, we shift our focus to **statistical measures** that describe the characteristics of a dataset.\n\nOne key aspect of data analysis is identifying a single value that represents the overall dataset. This is where **measures of central tendency** come into play. These are summary statistics that capture the center or typical value of a dataset, providing a concise numerical summary.\n\nThere are five commonly used averages: **mean**, **median**, and **mode**, collectively referred to as **simple averages**, and **geometric mean** and **harmonic mean**, known as **special averages**. In addition to these, there are **positional averages**, such as **quartiles**, **deciles**, and **percentiles**, which are determined based on the position of values within an ordered dataset. These measures provide insights into the central value and distribution of the data, making them fundamental tools for understanding and interpreting data patterns.\n\nIn this section, we will focus on **simple averages**, with a detailed discussion on positional averages and special averages following later.\n\n![Measures of central tendency](images/Measures%20of%20Central%20Tendency.png){style=\"text-align:center;\" fig-alt=\"Measures of central tendency\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"60%\"}\n\n[**Requisites of a Good Measure of Central Tendency:**]{.ui}\n\n-   It should be rigidly defined.\n\n-   It should be simple to understand & easy to calculate\n\n-   It should be based upon all values of given data\n\n-   It should be capable of further mathematical treatment.\n\n-   It should have sampling stability.\n\n-   It should be not be unduly affected by extreme values\n\n**The main objectives of Measure of Central Tendency:**\n\n-   To condense data in a single value.\n\n-   To facilitate comparisons between data.\n\n## Arithmetic mean\n\nThis is what people usually intend when they say \"average\". Arithmetic mean or simply the mean of a variable is defined as the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations. Mean of set of numbers $x_{1\\ },x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}$ is denoted as $\\overline{x}$. It is given by the formula\n\n$$\\overline{x} = \\frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + \\ldots + x_{n}}{n}$$\n\n$$= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i}$$ {#eq-mean}\n\n**Example 4.1** Find the mean of the numbers 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12\n\n$$\\overline{x} = \\frac{2 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 11 + 12}{6} = \\frac{44}{6} = 7.33$$\n\n### Mean of ungrouped frequency distribution\n\n[**Direct method**]{.underline}\n\nIf the numbers $x_{1\\ },x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}$ occur with frequencies $f_{1\\ },f_{2},\\ldots,f_{n}$ respectively then\n\n$$\\overline{x} = \\frac{x_{1}f_{1} + x_{2}f_{2\\ \\ } + \\ldots + x_{n}f_{n}}{f_{1} + f_{2} + \\ldots f_{n}}$$\n\n$$= \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{f_{i}x_{i}}}{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f_{i}}$$ {#eq-meanungrouped}\n\n**Example 4.2** @tbl-plantheight below shows the plant height of 50 plants.

It cannot be calculated for open-end classes.\n\n6.  It may lead to fallacious conclusions, if the details of the data from which it is computed are not given.\n\n## The median\n\nThe **median** is the middle value in a set of data when the values are arranged in order from smallest to largest. If there is an **odd** number of values, the median is the one in the middle, with half of the values smaller and half larger. If there is an **even** number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is a **positional measure**, which means it depends on the order of the data, not the actual values. It helps to find the central point of the data, especially when there are extreme values or outliers that could affect the average.\n\n## Median of ungrouped or raw data\n\nArrange the given *n* observations $x_{1\\ },x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}$ in ascending order. If the number of values is odd, median is the middle value. If the number of values is even, median is the mean of middle two values.\n\nArrange data in ascending then use the following formula\n\nWhen *n* is odd, Median = Md =$\\left( \\frac{n + 1}{2} \\right)^{\\text{th}}$value\n\nWhen *n* is even, Median = Md =${\\text{Average of}\\left( \\frac{n}{2} \\right)^{th}\\text{and }\\left( \\frac{n}{2} + 1 \\right)}^{\\text{th}}$value\n\n**Example 4.4** Find the median of each of the following sets of numbers.\n\n$a)$ 12, 15, 22, 17, 20, 26, 22, 26, 12\n\n$b)$ 4, 7, 9, 10, 5, 1, 3, 4, 12, 10\n\n**Solution 4.4**\n\n$a)$ Arranging the data in an increasing order of magnitude, we obtain 12, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 22, 26, 26. Here, N = 9 is odd, and so, median =$\\left( \\frac{9 + 1}{2} \\right)^{\\text{th}}$= 5^th^ ordered observation = 20.\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Note\"}\nIf a number is repeated, we still count it the number of times it appears when we calculate the median.\n:::\n\n$b)$ Arranging the data in an increasing order of magnitude, we obtain 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 10, 12. Here, N = 10 is an even number and so median = $\\frac{1}{2}${5^th^ ordered observation + 6^th^ ordered observation} = $\\frac{1}{2}\\left( 5 + 7 \\right) = 6$.\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Note\"}\nYou can see in each case, the median divides the distribution into two equal parts, with 50% of the observations greater than it and the other 50% less than it.\n:::\n\n## Median of ungrouped frequency distribution\n\nThe median is the middle number is an ordered set of data. In a frequency table, the observations are already arranged in an ascending order. We can obtain the median by looking for the value in the middle position.\n\n[**Odd number of observations**]{.underline}\n\nWhen the number of observations (*n*) is odd, then the median is the value at the $\\left( \\frac{n + 1}{2} \\right)^{\\text{th}}$ positional value. For that we use less than cumulative frequency.\n\n**Example 4.5**: The @tbl-score shows the frequency of the score obtained in a mathematics quiz. Find the median score.\n\n|               |     |     |     |     |     |\n|:--------------|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|\n| **Score**     | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |\n| **Frequency** | 3   | 4   | 7   | 6   | 3   |\n\n: Score obtained in a mathematics quiz {#tbl-score .bordered}\n\n**Solution 4.5:**\n\nTotal frequency = 3 + 4 + 7 + 6 + 3 = 23 (odd number). Since the number of scores is odd, the median is at $\\left( \\frac{23 + 1}{2} \\right)^{\\text{th}} =$ 12^th^ position.\n\n|                                    |     |     |        |     |     |\n|:-----------------------------------|:----|:----|:-------|:----|:----|\n| **Score**                          | 0   | 1   | **2**  | 3   | 4   |\n| **Frequency**                      | 3   | 4   | **7**  | 6   | 3   |\n| **less than cumulative frequency** | 3   | 7   | **14** | 20  | 23  |\n\n: Less than cumulative frequency of the scores in mathematics quiz {#tbl-mediansolution}\n\nTo find out the 12^th^ position, we use less than cumulative frequencies in @tbl-mediansolution which helps us track how many values are less than or equal to each score. In the table, the less than cumulative frequency for the score 0 is 3 (meaning the first 3 values are 0), for the score 1 is 7 (meaning the first 7 values are 0 and 1), and for the score 2 is 14 (meaning the first 14 values are 0, 1, and 2). If we list the data in order, it would look like this: 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2. (no need to list, this is just for reader's understanding, less than cumulative frequency is enough).\n\nNow, we need to find where the 12^th^ value falls. The 12th value is between the 7th and 14th values, so based on less than cumulative frequency it is clear that 12^th^ value is 2. So the median is 2.\n\n[**Even number of observations**]{.underline}\n\nWhen the number of observations is even, then the median is the average of ${\\left( \\frac{n}{2} \\right)^{th}\\text{and}\\left( \\frac{n}{2} + 1 \\right)}^{\\text{th}}$ position values.\n\n**Example 4.6**: The @tbl-median is a frequency table of the marks obtained in a competition.

Since the number of scores is even, the median is at the average of the values in ${\\left( \\frac{n}{2} \\right)^{th} = 25\\ and\\ \\left( \\frac{n}{2} + 1 \\right)}^{\\text{th}} = 26$ positions. To find out the 25^th^ position and 26^th^ position, we add up the frequencies as shown:\n\n|                                    |     |     |     |     |     |\n|:-----------------------------------|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|\n| **Mark**                           | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |\n| **Frequency**                      | 11  | 9   | 5   | 10  | 15  |\n| **less than cumulative frequency** | 11  | 20  | 25  | 35  | 50  |\n\n: Less than cumulative frequency of marks obtained. {#tbl-medianeven .bordered .hover}\n\nThe mark at the 25^th^ position is 2 and the mark at the 26^th^ position is 3. The median is the average of the scores at 25^th^ and 26^th^ positions = $\\frac{2 + 3}{2} = 2.5$\n\n## Median of grouped frequency distribution\n\nThe exact value of the median of a grouped data cannot be obtained because the actual values of a grouped data are not known. For a grouped frequency distribution, the median is in the class interval which contains the $\\left( \\frac{N}{2} \\right)^{\\text{th}}$ordered observation, where $N$ is the total number of observations. This class interval is called the **median class**. The median of a grouped frequency distribution can be estimated by either of the following two methods:\n\n[**Linear interpolation method**]{.underline}\n\nThe median of a grouped frequency distribution can be estimated by linear interpolation. We assume that the observations are evenly spread through the median class. The median can then be computed by using the following formula:\n\n$$Median = L + \\left( \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}N - F}{f_{m}} \\right)C$$ {#eq-medlinear}\n\nwhere $N$ = total number of observations, $L$ = lower limit of the median class, $F$ = sum of all frequencies below *L*(cumulative frequency), $f_{m}$ = frequency of the median class, $C$ = class width of the median class.\n\n[**Estimation from cumulative frequency curve**]{.underline}\n\nThe median of a grouped frequency distribution can be estimated from a cumulative frequency curve. A horizontal line is drawn from the point $\\frac{\\text{N}}{2}$ on the vertical axis to meet the cumulative frequency curve. From the point of intersection, a vertical line is dropped to the horizontal axis. The value on the horizontal axis is equal to the median.\n\n![median from a cumulative frequency curve](images/mediancf.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"50%\"}\n\n**Example 4.7** @tbl-medianheight below gives the distribution of the heights of 60 students in a senior high school.

Median can be located even if the data are incomplete.\n\n[**Demerits**]{.underline}\n\n1.  A slight change in the series may bring drastic change in median value.\n\n2.  In case of even number of items or continuous series, median is an estimated value other than any value in the series.\n\n3.  It is not suitable for further mathematical treatment except its use in calculating mean deviation.\n\n4.  It does not take into account all the observations.\n\n## The mode\n\nThe mode of a set of data is the value which occurs with the greatest frequency. The mode is therefore the most frequently occuring value in a dataset. The mode is an important measure in case of qualitative data. The mode can be used to describe both quantitative and qualitative data.\n\n### Mode of ungrouped or raw data\n\nFor ungrouped data or a series of individual observations, mode is often found by mere inspection.\n\n**Example 4.8**\n\n$a)$ The modes of 1, 2, 2, 2, 3 is 2.\n\n$b)$ The modes of 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5 are 4 and 5.\n\n$c)$ The mode does not exist when every observation has the same frequency. For example, the following sets of data have no modes: (i) 3, 6, 8, 9; (ii) 4, 4, 4, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9.\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Note\"}\nIt can be seen that the mode of a distribution may not exist, and even if it exists, it may not be unique. Distributions with a single mode are referred to as *unimodal*. Distributions with two modes are referred to as *bimodal*. Distributions may have several modes, in which case they are referred to as *multimodal*.\n:::\n\n**Example 4.9** 20 patients selected at random had their blood groups determined.

The mode of the data is therefore blood group O. We can say that most of the patients selected have blood group O. Notice that the mean and the median cannot be applied to the data. This is because the variable \"blood group\" cannot take numerical values. However, it can be seen that the mode can be used to describe both quantitative and qualitative data.\n\n## Mode of grouped data\n\nMode of a grouped frequency distribution can be found out using the formula below.\n\n$$mode = L + \\left( \\frac{f_{m}-f_{p}}{2f_{m}-f_{p} - f_{s}} \\right)C$$ {#eq-mode}\n\nLocate the highest frequency the class corresponding to that frequency is called the **modal class**.\n\nWhere, $L$ = lower limit of the modal class; $f_{m}$ = the frequency of modal class; $f_{p}$= the frequency of the class preceding the modal class; $f_{s}$= the frequency of the class succeeding the modal class and $C$ = class interval\n\n**Example 4.10** For the frequency distribution of weights of sorghum ear-heads given in @tbl-earhead below. Calculate the mode.\n\n| Weights of ear heads (g) | No of ear heads (*f*) |\n|:------------------------:|:---------------------:|\n|          60-80           |          22           |\n|          80-100          |          38           |\n|         100-120          |          45           |\n|         120-140          |          35           |\n|         140-160          |          20           |\n\n: frequency distribution of weights of sorghum ear heads {#tbl-earhead .bordered}\n\nModal class is **100-120**, since it is the class with highest frequency.\n\nUsing @eq-mode mode is calculated as below.\n\n$mode = 100 + \\left( \\frac{45-35}{90-38-35} \\right)20 =$ 111.76\n\n[**Mode using Histogram**]{.underline}\n\nConsider the figure below. The modal class is the class interval which corresponds to rectangle $\\text{ABCD}$. An estimate of the mode of the distribution is the abscissa of the point of intersection of the line segments $\\overline{\\text{AE}}$ and $\\overline{\\text{BF}}$ in the figure.\n\n!['Median from a cumulative frequency curve for Example 4.10](images/l2m1.jpeg){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"50%\"}\\\n**Merits and Demerits of Mode**\n\n[*Merits*]{.underline}\n\n1.  It is readily comprehensible and easy to compute. In some case it can be computed merely by inspection.\n\n2.  It is not affected by extreme values. It can be obtained even if the extreme values are not known.\n\n3.  Mode can be determined in distributions with open classes.\n\n4.  Mode can be located on the graph also.\n\n5.  Mode can be used to describe both quantitative and qualitative data.\n\n[*Demerits*]{.underline}\n\n1.  The mode is not unique. That is, there can be more than one mode for a given set of data.\n\n2.  The mode of a set of data may not exist.\n\n3.  It is not based upon all the observation.\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Historical Insights\"}\n**Ancient wall measuring with the mode!**\n\nBack in the 5^th^ century BCE, the Athenians used a clever \"statistical hack\" to plan their siege of Platea. Soldiers counted bricks in an unplastered section of the wall multiple times, and the most frequent count (what we now call the mode) was taken as the best estimate. They then multiplied this by the height of a brick to calculate the wall’s height and build ladders tall enough to scale it. Problem-solving with statistics!\n\n**Asrtonomy and the mean**\n\nAlthough the Greeks knew the concept of the arithmetic mean, it wasn’t generalized for multiple values until the 16^th^ century. Simon Stevin’s invention of the decimal system in 1585 made it much easier to calculate. Astronomer Tycho Brahe was one of the first to use the mean, reducing errors in his estimates of celestial body locations.\n\n**Navigation and the median**\n\nThe concept of the median first appeared in 1599 in Edward Wright’s book on navigation, *Certaine errors in navigation*. Wright used it to determine the most likely value in a series of compass readings. Later, in 1669, Christiaan Huygens noticed the difference between the mean and the median while working with Graunt's tables. It’s amazing how these early navigators and mathematicians paved the way for the stats we use today.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Quotes to Inspire\"}\n**\"If the statistics are boring, you've got the wrong numbers\":- Edward R.
