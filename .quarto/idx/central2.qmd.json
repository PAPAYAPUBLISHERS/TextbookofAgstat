Unlike the arithmetic mean, which calculates the average by summing values, the geometric mean finds the average by multiplying values and then taking the root (typically the *n*^th^ root for *n* values).\n\nThis approach captures the compounding effects present in the data, making the geometric mean an essential tool for accurately summarizing proportional changes or rates over time. Its utility lies in providing a more representative measure for datasets where changes are multiplicative rather than additive.\n\nThe geometric mean of a series containing *n* observations is the *n*^th^ root of the product of the values. If $x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots, x_{n}$ are observations then\n\n$$GM = \\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}$$ {#eq-gm1}\\\nwhere $\\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i$ means the product of $x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots, x_{n}$\n\n$$= \\left( x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_n \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}$$\n\n$$\\log \\text{GM} = \\frac{1}{n} \\log \\left( x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_n \\right)$$\n\n$$= \\frac{1}{n} \\left( \\log x_1 + \\log x_2 + \\cdots + \\log x_n \\right)$$\n\n$$= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log x_i}{n}$$ {#eq-gm2}\n\n$$\\text{GM} = \\text{Antilog} \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log x_i}{n} \\right)$$ {#eq-gm3}\n\n### Geometric mean for frequency table\n\n$$\\text{GM} = \\text{Antilog} \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i \\log x_i}{n} \\right)$$ {#eq-gm4}\n\nwhere $x_{i}$ is the *i*^th^ value in the dataset and for a grouped frequency table $x_{i}$ will be the midpoint of the *i*^th^ class interval calculated as the average of upper and lower limit, $f_{i}$ is the frequency of the *i*^th^ value or class , *k* is the number of classes.\n\n**Example 5.1** If the weight of sorghum ear heads are 45, 60, 48, 100, 65 gms.

Pipe A can fill the cistern in 3 hours. Pipe B can fill the cistern in 5 hours. If both pipes are opened at the same time, how long will it take to fill the cistern completely?\n\n**Solution 5.6**\\\nTo solve the cistern problem, we first calculate the rate at which each pipe fills the cistern. Pipe A fills the cistern in 3 hours, so its rate is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the cistern per hour. Pipe B fills the cistern in 5 hours, so its rate is $\\frac{1}{5}$ per hour. To find the combined rate, we add these rates together; $\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{8}{15}$. This means the two pipes together fill $\\frac{8}{15}$ of the cistern each hour. To find the total time, we take the reciprocal of the combined rate *i*.*e*. $\\text{Total time} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{8}{15}} = \\frac{15}{8} = 1.875$. To convert 1.875 hours into hours and minutes, we first separate the whole number from the decimal part. 1.875 hours consists of 1 hour (the whole number) and 0.875 hours (the decimal part). Next, we convert the decimal part into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we multiply 0.875 by 60 *i*.*e*. $0.875 \\times 60 = 52.5 \\, \\text{minutes}$. Rounding 52.5 minutes gives approximately 53 minutes. Thus, 1.875 hours is equivalent to **1 hour and 53 minutes**.\n\n\\\nThe problem can be easily solved using the harmonic mean, the harmonic mean of two pipes is\n\n$$\nHM=\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{3} +\\frac{1}{5}}\n$$\n\n$$= \\frac{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5}{3 + 5} = \\frac{30}{8} = 3.75 \\, \\text{hours}$$\n\nthe harmonic mean of the pipes is 3.75 hours, and since both pipes are working together, the total time is half of that, which confirms the answer of 1 hour and 53 minutes.\n\n**Example 5.7** A car travels a certain distance from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h, and returns the same distance from City B to City A at a speed of 90 km/h. What is the average speed for the entire trip?\n\n**Solution 5.7**\n\nTo find the average speed when traveling the same distance at two different speeds, we use the harmonic mean. The harmonic mean for the speed is $\\frac{2 \\cdot S_1 \\cdot S_2}{S_1 + S_2}$, where $S_1 = 60 \\, \\text{km/h}$ is the speed from City A to City B, $S_2 = 90 \\, \\text{km/h}$ is the speed from City B to City A.\n\nIn this case, we are calculating the average speed over the entire round trip. The harmonic mean is used because it accounts for the fact that traveling at different speeds over the same distance results in an overall average speed that is closer to the lower of the two speeds, rather than simply averaging the two speeds.\n\nNow, applying the harmonic mean formula:\n\n$S_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 60 \\cdot 90}{60 + 90} = \\frac{10800}{150} = 72 \\, \\text{km/h}$\n\nSo, the average speed for the entire trip is 72 km/h.\n\n**Merits and demerits of harmonic mean**\n\n[**Merits**]{.underline}\n\n-   It is rigidly defined.\n\n-   It is defined on all observations.\n\n-   It is amenable to further algebraic treatment.\n\n-   It is the most suitable average when it is desired to give greater weight to smaller and less weight to the larger ones.\n\n[**Demerits**]{.underline}\n\n-   It is not easily understood.\n\n-   It is difficult to compute.\n\n-   It is only a summary figure and may not be the actual item in the series.\n\n-   It gives greater importance to small items and is therefore, useful only when small items have to be given greater weightage.\n\n-   It is rarely used in grouped data.\n\n## AM, GM or HM ?\n\nThe arithmetic mean (AM), geometric mean (GM), and harmonic mean (HM) are termed as **Pythagorean means**. The Pythagorean means refer to three specific types of means that were known to the ancient Greek mathematicians, particularly to Pythagoras and his followers. Choosing the right average depends on what you’re measuring and how the data behaves. Let’s break it down step by step in a simple way:\n\n**Arithmetic Mean (AM)**\\\nThe arithmetic mean is the most common type of average. You use it when the values in your data add together in a straightforward way. This is suitable for quantities like:\\\n- Heights or weights\\\n- Lengths or distances\\\n- Marks in exams\n\nFor example, if you want to find the average height of students in a class, you add up all the heights and divide by the number of students. The arithmetic mean gives a meaningful average because height or weight adds linearly.\n\n**Harmonic Mean (HM)**\\\nThe harmonic mean is useful when you are working with rates, ratios, or situations where quantities add up as reciprocals. Some examples include:\\\n- Speeds (distance per unit time)\\\n- Capacitors in a series circuit\\\n- Rates like fuel efficiency or cost per unit\n\nFor instance, imagine you are driving the same distance at different speeds. If you want to find the average speed for the entire trip, the harmonic mean is the best choice. This is because speeds relate inversely to time when you go faster, you take less time, and vice versa.\n\n**Geometric Mean (GM)**\\\nThe geometric mean is the right choice when your data involves multiplication or compounding, such as:\\\n- Growth rates (like population growth or interest rates)\\\n- Percentages (like inflation rates)\\\n- Ratios\n\nFor example, if you have annual interest rates for 10 years and want to find a single rate that represents the same total growth over that period, the geometric mean gives you the answer. It works by multiplying the rates and taking the root, which accounts for the compounding effect.\n\nHere’s a simple example to understand how the geometric mean works. Suppose you invest Rs.100, and your investment changes over three years as follows: in the first year, it grows by 10%, represented by a growth factor of 1.10; in the second year, it grows by 20%, represented by 1.20; and in the third year, it drops by 10%, represented by 0.90. To find a single rate that would give the same overall growth over the three years, you multiply the growth factors: $1.10 \\times 1.20 \\times 0.90 = 1.188$. Then, take the cube root (since there are three years): $\\sqrt[3]{1.188} \\approx 1.059$. This gives a geometric mean rate of approximately 1.059, or 5.9% per year. In other words, if your Rs. 100 investment grew steadily at a rate of 5.9% each year, it would result in the same total growth over three years, leaving you with about Rs. 118.80 at the end.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\\\n1. Use **Arithmetic Mean** when values combine directly, like adding lengths or weights.\\\n2. Use **Harmonic Mean** for rates or quantities that work reciprocally, like speed or resistance.\\\n3. Use **Geometric Mean** for data involving multiplication or compounding, like growth rates or percentages.\n\nBy understanding the relationship between the data and the type of average, you can choose the most meaningful measure for your analysis.\n\n## Relation between AM, GM and HM\n\nThe formula for the relation between AM, GM, HM is the product of arithmetic mean and harmonic mean is equal to the square of the geometric mean. This can be presented here in the form of @eq-amgmhm\n\n$$\\mathbf{\\text{AM}}\\mathbf{\\times}\\mathbf{\\text{HM}}\\mathbf{=}\\mathbf{\\text{GM}}^{\\mathbf{2}}$$ {#eq-amgmhm}\n\nalso\n\n$$\\mathbf{AM \\geq GM \\geq HM}$$ {#eq-gretamgmhm}\n\n### Geometric illustration\n\nConsider two numbers a and b. See @fig-semiam a semi circle can be drawn with diameter a+b. Then its radius is half the diameter, which will be the arithmetic mean $\\frac{a+b}{2}$.\n\n![Arithmetic mean on a semi circle](images/semiam.png){#fig-semiam fig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\" style=\"text-align:center;\"}\n\nThe geometric mean is the length of the perpendicular where a and b meet, which is never larger than the radius of the circle as illustrated in @fig-semigm\n\n![Geometric mean on a semi circle](images/semigm.png){#fig-semigm fig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\" style=\"text-align:center;\"}\n\nNow draw a line from the top of red line which is the GM in @fig-semigm to the center of the circle. Now that line is the radius of the circle, so it is equal to AM, which is now the hypotenuse of the newly formed triangle with GM as the leg of the triangle. So from @fig-semiamgm it is clear that\n\n$$\\mathbf{AM \\geq GM}$$ {#eq-amgm}\n\n![Geometric mean and aritmetic mean on a semi circle](images/semiamgm.png){#fig-semiamgm fig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\" style=\"text-align:center;\"}\n\nNow if we draw an altitude to the hypotenuse as shown in @fig-semiamgm, the upper length on the hypotenuse is the harmonic mean . We can now consider another triangle where HM is a leg and the GM is the hypotenuse, this shows the GM is never smaller than the HM. So $$\\mathbf{GM \\geq HM}$$ {#eq-gmhm}\n\n![AM, GM and HM on a semi circle](images/semiamgmhm.png){#fig-semiamgmhm fig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\" style=\"text-align:center;\"}\n\nNow from @eq-amgm and @eq-gmhm it is clear that $\\mathbf{AM \\geq GM \\geq HM}$\n\n## Positional averages {#sec-positional_avg}\n\nPositional averages are measures derived directly from the values in a dataset. These averages are based on the position of the values within the series and are used to represent the overall dataset or highlight specific positional characteristics.\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Note\"}\nThe **median** although a simple average is also a positional average that represents the middle value of an ordered dataset, making it a central point of reference. Similarly, the **mode**, which identifies the most frequently occurring value in the dataset, is also a positional average since it is directly taken from the series.\n:::\n\nThe other common positional averages include **percentiles**, **quartiles**, and **deciles**, which divide the data into equal parts to analyze its distribution.\n\nIn contrast, measures like the **arithmetic mean**, **geometric mean**, and **harmonic mean** are referred to as **mathematical averages**, as they are calculated through specific mathematical operations rather than being derived from the data's positional properties.\n\n## Quartiles {#sec-quartile}\n\nThe **median** divides a dataset into two equal halves. Similarly, it is possible to divide a dataset into more than two parts. When an **ordered** dataset is divided into four equal sections, the points that mark these divisions are called **quartiles**.\n\nThe **first or lower quartile (**$\\mathbf{Q}_{\\mathbf{1}}$**)** is a value that has one fourth, or 25% of the observations below its value.\n\nThe **second quartile (**$\\mathbf{Q}_{\\mathbf{2}}$**)**, has one-half, or 50% of the observations below its value. The second quartile is equal to the **median**.\n\nThe **third or upper quartile**, **(**$\\mathbf{Q}_{\\mathbf{3}}$**)**, is a value that has three-fourths, or 75% of the observations below it. If there are *n* items in a dataset then\n\n$$Q_1 = \\left( \\frac{n + 1}{4} \\right)^{\\text{th}} {\\text{item}}$$ {#eq-quartileq1}\n\n$$Q_3 = \\left( \\frac{3(n + 1)}{4} \\right)^{\\text{th}} {\\text{item}}$$ {#eq-quartileq2}\n\nCalculations of quartiles are explained using the example below.

The *p*^th^ percentile, denoted as $P_p$, is the value below which *x* percent of the data falls.\n\nFor example:\\\n- The $\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathbf{50}}$, **50th percentile** is equivalent to the **median**, representing the middle value of the dataset.\\\n- The $\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathbf{25}}$, **25th percentile** corresponds to the first quartile ($Q_1$), which marks the lower 25% of the data.\\\n- The $\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathbf{75}}$, **75th percentile** is the third quartile ($Q_3$), indicating that 75% of the data falls below this value.\n\nFor raw data, first arrange the *n* observations in increasing order. Then the *x*^th^ percentile is given by\n\n$$P_p = \\left( \\frac{p(n + 1)}{100} \\right)^{\\text{th}} \\text{ item}$$ {#eq-percentilesingle1}\n\n**Percentiles of discrete frequency data**\n\nTo calculate percentiles for discrete frequency data, follow these steps which is similar to that of quartiles:\n\n1.  Find the cumulative frequencies\n\n2.  Find the position of the percentile. For the $p$-th percentile, calculate the position using the formula: $$\n    P_p = \\left( \\frac{p(n + 1)}{100} \\right)\n    $$ where $p$ is the percentile and $n$ is the total number of data points.\n\n3.  Identify the value in the cumulative frequencies\n\nfind the cumulative frequency that is just greater than or equal to the calculated position $P_p$. The corresponding value of $x$ is the $p$-th percentile.\n\nFor example, to find the first percentile ($P_1$): - Calculate $P_1 = \\left( \\frac{1(n + 1)}{100} \\right)$. - Locate the cumulative frequency that is just greater than $P_1$, and the corresponding value of $x$ is $P_1$.\n\n**Percentiles of a grouped frequency data**\n\nCalculation of percentile is very much similar to that of quartile.
